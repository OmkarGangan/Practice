# Program to calculate Area of Triangle

# Declare Variable and accept user input

b = float(input("Enter value of Base (in cm) => "))
h = float(input("Enter value of Height (in cm) => "))

# Calculating Area (a)

a = (b*h)/2

# Print processed output

print("Area of Triange (in cm) is ",a)
